# Markdown Writing Best Practices

## Formatting Standards
1. Use bold for emphasis sparingly
2. Use italics for foreign terms or emphasis
3. Use blockquotes for important notes or citations
4. Include proper spacing between sections
5. Use tables when presenting structured data
6. Use sentence case for titles and headings (not camel case or title case)
   - Only capitalize the first word and proper nouns
   - ✅ "Getting started with GitHub Actions"
   - ✅ "What is GitHub Actions?"
   - ❌ "Getting Started With GitHub Actions"
   - ❌ "GettingStartedWithGitHubActions"
   - ❌ "What Is GitHub Actions?"
7. Make section titles more human-like and conversational
   - ✅ "Let's get started with your first workflow"
   - ✅ "How to manage secrets in your workflows"
   - ❌ "Managing secrets"
   - ❌ "Workflow configuration"
